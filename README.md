# My portfolio 
added all of my content and created a new repo because I didn't read the requirements enough.
I decided to create a home page and an info page. I think it turned out well. there are CSS animations that I took online and modified. Hover effects are pretty simple but effective. the mobile version looks almost identical to the large screen version. I thought this looked nice.
the info page had a little more on hover effects and I used some box-shadow.
all of the images are hyperlinks to the corresponding project.
